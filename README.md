<h1>Seabattles</h1></br>
This is a client-server turn-based MMORPG</br>
All players placed their command within turntime and then, when turn is ended, server calculating result of the turn</br>
Thus, this game is simultanenious</br>
Each turn lasts 5 min (30 sec in debug mode)</br> 
You play as ship's captain, who rule a ship with a hard hand</br>
If usual game about sea is about wars between human nations in Carib sea, this is true another story:</br>
When you start game, you can select one of a few races:</br>
humans, orcs, elves, dwarves, furries, and others.</br>
Each race has uniq abilities and ships, so gamestyle will be different when you play for this races.</br>
Of course, there are guild system, exping, and so on.</br>
The game is creating because of I want to recreate MMORPG style. There is full loot after each death, for an example.<br>
